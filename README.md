# SYNDICATES & EMPIRES

Unity C# architecture for a real-time economy and strategy game.

## Play in browser

- Live WebGL game: <https://mymh121-spec.github.io/SyndicatesAndEmpires/>
- No installation or login is required. A desktop Chrome, Edge, Firefox, or Safari browser is recommended.
- Public releases target WebGL on GitHub Pages. Windows builds are local validation artifacts and are not distributed.

## Included

- Pure C# domain layer for resources, companies, factories, warehouses, markets, missions, and AI.
- Unity `ScriptableObject` data definitions for resources, recipes, missions, and AI profiles.
- Market price calculation driven by supply, demand, stock, and physical market absorption.
- Turn-based simulation engine with an explicit planning and resolution pipeline.
- Assembly definitions separating Domain, Application, Data, Presentation, and Editor code.
- Starter resource assets for iron, coal, wood, food, steel, machinery, medicine, and semiconductors.
- Korean-first player-facing names and a Korean localization table asset.
- Reusable order books with allocation-conscious matching for market settlement.
- Shipment routes, technology research, company operating costs, and turn performance metrics.
- A simulation settings asset and EditMode tests for core economic invariants.
- A 30-turn campaign with bankruptcy, capital destruction, economic dominance, and final ranking outcomes.
- A Civilization-scale 80×48 flat world with horizontal globe wrapping, one player base, three AI opponent bases, biomes, and protected company start tiles.
- Two readable mine types: pickaxe-marked industrial mines and coin-marked gold mines.
- A Korean single-player final-result view that resets both simulation state and the map after confirmation.
- An integrated world turn that moves factory inputs and outputs, warehouse stock, trade cash, operating costs, debt, and economic power through real domain objects.
- Real-time map gameplay with a Korean action panel, player and AI units, horizontally wrapped land pathfinding, mine capture, ownership markers, and daily mine production.
- Single-player neutral-castle occupation with garrison tracking, faction flags, selectable outpost roles, and defended-siege state transitions.
- Distinct military-site rules: headquarters/castles recruit from recovering local manpower pools, while mines allow one guard and never recruit locally.
- Release-MVP sea travel: friendly coastal castles act as simple ports with automatic embarkation and disembarkation; fleets, naval combat, and amphibious assaults remain optional extensions.
- A disabled-by-default HIVE platform extension slot keeps future authentication, achievements, cloud-save, analytics, and notification integrations outside the playable core.

## Open in Unity

1. Open this folder as a Unity project.
2. Use Unity 6.3 LTS `6000.3.21f1`.
3. Open the menu `게임 > 기본 경제 에셋 생성` if you want to regenerate the sample data.
4. Reference `Assets/Game/Scripts/Application/SimulationEngine.cs` as the entry point for the simulation.

## WebGL deployment

- Install Unity's Web Build Support module for `6000.3.21f1`.
- Use Unity menu `게임 > SYNDICATES & EMPIRES WebGL 제출 빌드`, or run Unity in batch mode with `-buildTarget WebGL -executeMethod Game.Editor.StandaloneBuild.BuildWebGlSubmission`.
- The command writes a GitHub Pages-ready build to `docs/`, including `.nojekyll` and a responsive Korean loading page.
- See `SUBMISSION_TRACK1_KO.txt` for the final title, short description, controls, and Codex collaboration notes.

## Optional local Windows build

- This build is for local validation only and is not part of the public release.
- Use Unity menu `게임 > Windows EXE 빌드` to create the standalone game.
- When a `D:` drive is available, the default output is `D:\SyndicatesAndEmpires\Builds\Windows\SyndicatesAndEmpires.exe`.
- Set `SYNDICATES_AND_EMPIRES_BUILD_ROOT` before launching Unity to choose another build root.
- Run `RUN_WINDOWS_EXE.cmd`; it checks the D: build first and falls back to the project-local `Builds` folder.

## Korean-first UI

Internal IDs and C# identifiers remain in English for maintainability. Player-facing names are Korean by default:

- `Assets/Game/Data/Localization/korean.asset` contains common UI labels.
- Resource, recipe, and mission assets use Korean display names.
- Add `LocalizedTextLabel` to a Unity UI `Text` component and assign the Korean table plus a key such as `ui.market`, `ui.next_day`, or `ui.market_price`.
- `KoreanFormat` formats money, prices, quantities, percentages, and game days for Korean UI.

## Play mode selection

- Entering Play Mode opens a Korean `1인이서 하기` / `여러 명이서 하기` selection screen before the map or mode-specific assets are created.
- The common map and selected mode service are created only after the player chooses a mode.
- Single-player activates the local simulation and AI companies without a server.
- Single-player creates an 80×48 flat world with visible faction castles. Use WASD/arrow keys or drag with the middle mouse button to pan, use the mouse wheel to zoom, press `L` to return to the player faction center, and press `Space` to pause or resume; east/west wraps while north/south remains bounded.
- A new single-player game starts with 500,000 won and one player unit already selected at headquarters.
- Map play is real-time: a unit has 10 stamina, movement costs 1 stamina, and 1 stamina regenerates every six in-game hours. Speed buttons affect the clock, movement, capture, AI, and stamina recovery together.
- Units use the existing six military archetypes: swordsman, spearman, maceman, archer, slinger, and cavalry. The headquarters panel lets the player cycle the unit type before recruitment.
- Left-clicking selects a tile. Right-clicking opens context actions for troop inspection, missions, movement, mining, and capture. Speed is selected with the on-screen 1–4× buttons, while pause/resume also supports `Space`.
- Multiplayer supports direct authoritative-server connection plus an optional HIVE individual-matchmaking path. HIVE finds players; the C# server still resolves the game.
- Returning to mode selection disconnects multiplayer and prevents both simulation paths from running together.
- See `GAME_MODE_SELECTION_KO.md` for the player flow and setup details.

## Single-player save and continue

- Press `Esc` → `싱글플레이 저장` for the manual slot. The HUD and pause menu report completion or storage errors.
- An independent automatic slot is saved after each complete daily settlement, when returning to mode selection, and when the application pauses. Starting a new game resets both economy and map; its autosaves do not overwrite the manual slot.
- The main menu offers `이어하기 · 자동 저장` and `이어하기 · 수동 저장`, with the saved game day. Loading displays progress and resumes paused; press `Space` or a speed button to continue.
- Desktop saves use `Application.persistentDataPath/SinglePlayerSaves`. WebGL saves use IndexedDB for the current site and browser profile. Clearing site data removes browser saves; they are not cloud saves or shared with multiplayer. Closing a browser tab cannot guarantee a final asynchronous write, so wait for manual-save completion before closing.
- Each slot retains its previous valid copy. Checksums detect damaged data, and loading falls back to that copy. Desktop writes use a flushed temporary file and atomic replacement; browser writes acknowledge the completed IndexedDB transaction.
- The format stores initial configuration, semantic player actions and compacted fixed simulation advances. Replay reconstructs economy, AI, map orders and pending operations, then restores the clock remainder, selection and camera. Long campaigns take longer to load. Schema, simulation rules and initial-data fingerprints reject incompatible saves instead of silently using different rules. When changing simulation behavior, update `SinglePlayerSave.CurrentRules`; new state-changing UI actions must be recorded and replayed.

Save validation:

- `dotnet run --project Validation/SinglePlayerSaveSmoke` (.NET 8): three seeds, 63 simulated days, replay equivalence, clock remainder, deterministic continuation and invalid-record rejection. This checks the pure simulation and DTO, not Unity's JSON codec or UI.
- `node Validation/SinglePlayerWebStorageBrowserSmoke/server.cjs`, then open `http://127.0.0.1:8127`: actual IndexedDB persistence across reload, a 1.3 MB Unicode payload, separate slots and storage-error callbacks using the game's `.jslib`. Run on this isolated local origin, not the live game. The harness substitutes Unity's string/SendMessage bridge, so a real WebGL build is still required to validate that bridge.
- In Unity Test Runner, run the EditMode fixture `Game.Tests.Playability.SinglePlayerSaveTests` for full controller/JSON save-load, queued commands, corruption recovery, failed writes, incompatible saves and new-game/multiplayer isolation. `Validation/UnityCoreCompile` also compiles the save UI and storage code against the installed Unity assemblies.

## Extended MVP systems

- `LogisticsService` advances shipments in batches without a `MonoBehaviour` per vehicle.
- `TechnologyState` tracks prerequisites, research progress, and completed effects.
- `CompanyFinanceSystem` processes wages, maintenance, interest, debt, and bankruptcy.
- `TurnBatchRunner` spreads multi-turn simulation across frames.
- `Assets/Game/Resources/SimulationSettings.asset` controls market volatility, target stock, world generation, events, military logistics, order limits, batching, and operating costs.
- `CampaignVictoryEvaluator` checks the 3x combined-opponent economic dominance rule from turn 15 and ends the campaign at turn 30.
- `WorldEconomyTurnService` resolves production, logistics arrivals, market settlement, company finance, and asset valuation before campaign evaluation.
- `AICompanyTurnService` submits deterministic buy and sell orders from prior market shortages and surpluses while respecting company cash, stock, and warehouse capacity.
- Transport-independent PvP foundations validate authenticated identity, ownership, revision, turn sequence, replayed requests, per-player action points, readiness, deterministic command packages, and SHA-256 checksums.
- `IPvpTransport` and `IPvpMessageCodec` keep NGO, Mirror, Photon, WebSocket, and custom server adapters outside the game rules.
- `PvpAuthoritativeGateway` provides server-authoritative routing, bounded idempotency caching, request-conflict detection, and reconnect snapshots.
- Open Unity Test Runner and run `Game.Tests.EditMode` to verify market, inventory, production, AI, PvP, finance, game-mode, turn, and campaign rules.
- Run `Game.Tests.PlayMode` to verify the real menu lifecycle, initial unit selection, map movement, 360-day campaign completion, and final-result UI.

## Architecture

`Game.Domain` contains no Unity API. `Game.Application` orchestrates turn resolution. `Game.Data` adapts ScriptableObjects into domain definitions. `Game.Presentation` is intentionally small and should contain the Unity-facing composition root and views.

## Real-time flow

The playable map runs continuously. Player and AI map actions use regenerating per-unit stamina rather than daily action points. Production, markets, finance, events, and victory checks are resolved automatically at each in-game midnight, preserving deterministic daily settlement without requiring a turn-end button.

## Important rule

Do not set a resource price directly from a mission or UI. Missions should change production nodes, routes, inventory, or factory condition. The market then derives the price from those physical changes.
